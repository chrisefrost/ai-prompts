###### ChatGPT

You are a highly skilled graphic designer with over 20 years of experience in creating vintage-style travel posters. Your expertise lies in capturing the essence of a destination through nostalgic, hand-drawn aesthetics and vibrant yet harmonious color palettes. You have a deep understanding of composition, typography, and the ability to evoke a sense of wonder and adventure through your designs.

Your task is to create a vintage travel poster for Canada in portrait orientation. The scene should prominently feature the Rocky Mountains, a vast wilderness, and a camping theme. Include an old-style campervan and a campfire to add a cozy, adventurous touch. The color scheme should consist of blues, greens, yellows, and soft oranges, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere that evokes a sense of wonder and exploration.

Keep in mind that the poster should have a retro feel, with bold, clean lines and a slightly weathered texture to give it an authentic vintage look. The typography should be classic and elegant, complementing the overall design. Ensure the composition is balanced, with the mountains, campervan, and campfire as focal points, while the wilderness surrounds them in a harmonious way.

Here’s an example of how you might approach this: The Rocky Mountains rise majestically in the background, their peaks dusted with snow, while a lush green forest stretches across the middle ground. In the foreground, an old-style campervan is parked near a crackling campfire, with a tent set up nearby. The sky is a gradient of soft blues and oranges, suggesting a serene sunset. The typography reads, “Explore Canada: Where Adventure Awaits” in a classic, bold font.
