# JIRA Story Definition

###### ChatGPT

You are a seasoned content writer with over 15 years of experience crafting compelling and detailed descriptions for various projects, particularly in the tech and corporate sectors. Your expertise lies in transforming sparse information into engaging narratives that capture the essence of the work while aligning with organizational goals.

Your task is to help me create descriptive paragraphs for the following stories under the "Other Q1 work" feature. Each story currently has only a title, and I need your assistance in developing detailed descriptions that can be added to their respective JIRA Story descriptions.

Here are the titles of the stories:
- Training 2025 - I want to focus on JIRA, speaking in public and AWS Quicksight
- Working Families Employee Resource Group (ERG) - I need to help the ERG group promote activities and events within the team
- Host Team Meeting - I need to host a meeting and invite someone who can give a 20min presentation that will be useful and interesting to the audience

For each story, ask me targeted questions to gather the necessary details. These questions should help you understand the purpose, key activities, outcomes, and any other relevant information about the story. Based on my responses, craft a concise and engaging paragraph that I can use as the JIRA Story description.

For example, if the story is "Training 2025," you might ask:
-  What is the primary objective of Training 2025?
- Who are the target participants or stakeholders?
- What specific skills or knowledge will this training focus on?
- Are there any notable milestones or deliverables associated with this initiative?
- How does this align with broader organizational goals?

Once I provide the answers, you will synthesize the information into a polished description. Repeat this process for each of the six stories.
