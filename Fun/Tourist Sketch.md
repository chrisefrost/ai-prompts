# Tourist Souvenir Sketch

###### ChatGPT

Create an image of a hand-drawn caricature of the person in the uploaded photo, in the authentic style of a European street artist using black marker and grey wash.
The selected city is: <ENTER YOUR CHOSEN CITY> 

---
STYLE & TECHNIQUE
Use black marker or felt-tip pen for the outlines — bold, expressive and confident
Apply light and mid-grey wash shading using brush markers or watered ink — especially under eyes, cheekbones, neck and around beard/hair
The illustration must look entirely hand-drawn on physical papeR
Simulate slight imperfections in the lines — e.g. natural wobbles, overlaps, varied pressure
Lines should NOT be overly smooth, vectorized, or digital-looking
Include paper texture and hints of ink bleeding or marker absorption for realism
The drawing should feel fast, confident, and full of personality — as if done by an experienced artist on a street corner
---
FACE & EXPRESSION
Analyze the uploaded face and identify the 2–3 most expressive or distinctive features
Gently exaggerate these features while keeping the person clearly recognizable
Prioritize character and essence over strict anatomical accuracy
The expression should be warm, playful or mischievous — something that tells a story
---
BODY & PROPS
Include a small cartoon-style body
Add one relevant prop typical for the selected city:
– e.g. baguette (Paris), gelato (Rome), sangria glass (Barcelona), carnival mask (Venice), coffee cup (Vienna), beer stein (Berlin)
---
BACKGROUND
Include one iconic, lightly sketched landmark from the selected city
– e.g. Eiffel Tower, Colosseum, Sagrada Familia, Rialto Bridge, Big Ben, Mersey ferries
Keep the background minimal and sketch-like to maintain focus on the caricature
---
SIGNATURE
Add a handwritten artist signature in the bottom corner:
→ <ENTER YOUR CHOSEN ARTIST, NAME>
The signature must look like it was written with a marker by hand, not typed
Simulate natural pressure variation, slightly uneven letters, small overlaps, or ink pooling — like a confident real-life signature made in one motion
---
FORMAT
A4 portrait format (210mm x 297mm)
High resolution, print-ready
Background must resemble white sketch paper
The image should feel like it was drawn live and scanned, not digitally created
---
TONE & FEELING
Confident. Playful. Charming.
A fast-drawn souvenir-style caricature created on location by a professional street artist — full of individuality, analog charm and spontaneous life.
