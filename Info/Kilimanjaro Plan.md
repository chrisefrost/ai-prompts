# Kilimanjaro Plan

###### Gemini

Act as a team of people who will help me climb mount Kilimanjro including the following personalities with years of experience;
* a motivational coach who encourages me and helps me stay on track with training and preparation for Mount Kilimanjaro.
* a holistic planner, blending fitness training, nutrition advice, and practical tips for climbing Mount Kilimanjaro.
* an experienced mountaineer to advise me on fitness, food, and gear for Mount Kilimanjaro.
* a professional fitness coach and nutritionist to help me design a training and meal plan for climbing Mount Kilimanjaro.

Write a short biography of each coach and how they will help me.

Create a detailed step-by-step fitness and nutrition plan for someone preparing to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in March 2026. Have the plan start today. The plan should be split into 4 weekly cycles and include the following phases;
* Phase 1: Foundation (4 months)
* Phase 2: Building Stamina and Strength (4 months)
* Phase 3: Advanced Preparation (4 months)
* Phase 4: Final Tapering (2 months)

Each phase should be split into chunks of 4 weeks (i.e. Weeks 1-4, Week 5-8), and include sub categories of;
* Goal
* Focus
* Ideal weight
* Exercise Details
* Nutrition (Calorie intake, macronutrient ratio, sample meal plan)
* Key milestones

Exercise Details: Provide specifics on cardio workouts, strength training (including targeted exercises for legs, core, and back), flexibility routines, and hiking simulations. Include intensity levels, progression, and sample schedules.Â 
* On Tuesdays I have the opportunity to attend a spin class after work.
* I am child free every other weekend so can do more;
* On the Saturdays I dont have the children, I can do a long hike.
* On the Sundays I dont have the children, I can go for a swim (advise on target lengths/times)
* The weekends I have the boys, time is limited however we can still do short walks or cycling in delamere forest.
* Every Monday I can go swimming.
* Snowdon and Moel Famau are easily accessible for me and I am familiar with all Snowdon routes.
* Ideally you should include some Yoga or mindfulness exercises throughout the week.
* I am not a member of a gym so dont have access to any weights for exercising.

Based on the above, for every weekly cycle, suggest a daily exercise plan. For each individual activity, you should list the amount of exercises, number of repetiions and detailed instructions on how to perform it. You should also offer the same detailed for Yoga poses as per the example below;
* Monday: Swim (30-45 mins, introduce interval training: 2 lengths fast, 2 lengths easy).
* Tuesday: Spin class (increase resistance and duration slightly).
* Wednesday: Bodyweight circuit - make sure you include instrcutions for each exercise
  * Lunges: Step forward with one leg, bending both knees to 90 degrees. (Perform 12-15 reps per leg)
  * Incline Push-ups: Place your hands on an elevated surface (e.g., a sturdy box or bench) and perform push-ups.
  * Glute Bridges: Lie on your back with knees bent, lift your hips off the ground, squeezing your glutes.
* Thursday: Yoga/Mindfulness (45 minutes, introduce some strength-building poses). - Give example of what exercises to do in the yoga session
* Friday: Rest.
* Weekends: Delamere Forest walks with children. When child free, introduce longer walks (4-5 miles) on Saturdays and longer swims (45-60 minutes, focus on distance) on Sundays.


Nutrition Plan: Outline calorie requirements and macronutrient breakdowns for each phase. Include meal and snack ideas, hydration strategies, and advice on preparing for high-altitude conditions (e.g., foods that are easier to digest or boost red blood cell production). Include food and meal suggestions for Breakfast, Lunch, Tea and snacks in the following format;
* Breakfast: Scrambled eggs with wholemeal toast and avocado.
* Lunch: Leftover baked cod, or a large mixed green salad with grilled chicken or chickpeas.
* Tea (Dinner): Chicken stir-fry with brown rice and mixed vegetables.
* Snacks: Greek yogurt with fruit, rice cakes with avocado.

Foods I like include;
* Oats
* Avocados
* Shrimp and Prawns
* Rice and Pasta
* Jacket Potatoes
* Eggs
* Chicken
When breaking down the macronutrients, give example so of the food stuffs;
Protein: 190-215g (20-25% of calories) - is this chicken?
Carbohydrates: 380-430g (45-50% of calories) - is this bread?
Fat: 90-100g (25-30% of calories) - is this chocolate?

Simulation of Climb Conditions: Include advice on incorporating weighted backpacks, incline training, and tips for using altitude simulation (if available).

Key Milestones: Highlight specific achievements or fitness tests for each phase, such as long hikes, running distances, or strength benchmarks.

Final Week Preparation: Include advice on tapering, rest, and nutrition in the week leading up to the climb.

The plan should be realistic for someone currently recovering from a cold and chest infection, possibly Pneumania, but motivated to achieve peak fitness within 14 months. The tone should be practical, supportive, and tailored for success.

I currently weigh 90kgs and I am 5ft 9in tall. Include advice on weight targets.

Each section should be very detailed, and broken down into weekly sub categories with a proposed exercise schedule and training routine throughout the week as well as meal examples.
