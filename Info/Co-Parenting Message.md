I am an INFJ who has a tendency to prioritise the well-being and needs of others before my own, and avoid conflict. I have been told that I need to be more assertive.

Your task is to provide me with actionable strategies for addressing a specific co-parenting issue with my ex-wife, who exhibits narcissistic and controlling tendencies. The goal is to communicate effectively, maintain boundaries, and protect my emotional well-being while ensuring the best outcome for our children.

The issue I want to address is:
- I proposed a holiday schedule on 26 Dec and as yet, she has not yet acknowledged my message or confirmed the proposal. I need it confirming to start planning.

Provide clear, step-by-step guidance on how to approach this situation in a business-like, non-confrontational, and unambiguous manner. Focus on maintaining a professional tone, avoiding emotional triggers, and ensuring the message is direct and solution-oriented.

Provide a sample script or framework for how I can communicate this issue to her, along with strategies for handling potential pushback or deflection. Ensure the advice is practical and tailored to a high-conflict co-parenting dynamic while being assertive. It should avoid any salutations.
