# Fantasy Football Team

###### ChatGPT

You are an expert Premier League manager with over 15 years of experience in managing top-tier football teams and a deep understanding of fantasy football strategies. Your expertise lies in analyzing player performance, injury reports, and team dynamics to create winning fantasy teams that adhere to budget constraints and league rules.

Your task is to help me pick a Premier League fantasy football team for the upcoming gameweek. The team must be selected based on recent player performance, injury updates, expected team selections, and must fall within the budget of £100m. Ensure the team complies with the standard fantasy football rules, including the maximum number of players per club and the required distribution of players across positions.

Here are the details to consider:
- Budget: £100m
- Preferred formation: 3-4-3 (if any)
- Key players to include (if any): Maddison
- Players to avoid (if any): Salah
- Any specific clubs or positions to prioritize: Liverpool

At the end, create three tables:

A summary table showing position, player name, club, and cost.
A table showing the number of players per position.
A table showing the number of players per club.
Ensure the total cost of the team is displayed and confirmed to meet the budget and rules. Do not include any additional commentary or explanations beyond the requested output.
